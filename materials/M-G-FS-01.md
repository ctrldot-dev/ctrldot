# Goal Rationale: Reduce Unplanned Service Disruption

## What "Unplanned Disruption" Means

Unplanned service disruption occurs when:
- FieldServe becomes unavailable or degraded without prior notice
- Service orchestration fails due to system errors
- Customer operations are impacted by unexpected system behavior
- Dependencies (especially AssetLink) fail or change unexpectedly

## Business and Customer Impact

### Customer Impact
- Service delivery delays or failures
- Loss of visibility into field operations
- Inability to track service status
- Customer trust and satisfaction degradation

### Business Impact
- Increased support burden
- Potential SLA violations
- Reputational damage
- Operational inefficiency

## Why This Goal is Prioritized Now

This goal is prioritized because:
1. **Customer-Critical Operations**: FieldServe directly supports customer operations
2. **Dependency Complexity**: Growing dependency on AssetLink requires better coordination
3. **Incident History**: Recent incidents highlighted gaps in change management
4. **Scalability Concerns**: As the platform grows, unplanned disruptions become more costly

## How Success is Assessed

Success indicators include:
- **Quantitative**: Reduction in unplanned downtime incidents
- **Qualitative**: Improved incident response times
- **Operational**: Better visibility into system dependencies
- **Customer**: Fewer customer-reported service issues

## Relationship to Other Goals

This goal supports:
- **SO-1**: Improve reliability and explainability of customer-critical services
- **FS-G2**: Explainability after deployment helps prevent future disruptions
