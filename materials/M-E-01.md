# Incident Review Summary

**Note**: This summary was AI-assisted but reviewed and approved by human incident responders.

## Incident Overview

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Duration**: 4 hours  
**Severity**: P1 (Customer Impact)  
**Affected Systems**: FieldServe, AssetLink  
**Root Cause**: AssetLink schema change broke FieldServe service orchestration logic

## What Went Wrong

### The Change
AssetLink deployed a schema change that renamed the `asset_status` field to `current_state` in their asset data model. This change was:
- Deployed during a scheduled maintenance window
- Documented in AssetLink's internal changelog
- Not explicitly communicated to FieldServe team

### The Failure
FieldServe's service orchestration logic relied on the `asset_status` field to make routing decisions. When the field was renamed:
- FieldServe could not read asset state
- Service orchestration decisions failed
- Customer service requests were not routed correctly
- Some services were delayed, others were routed incorrectly

### Detection
The issue was detected when:
- Customer support received reports of incorrect service routing
- Field operations teams noticed missing service assignments
- Monitoring showed increased error rates in FieldServe API

## What Information Was Missing at the Time

During incident response, teams discovered:
1. **No Explicit Dependency Record**: The relationship between AssetLink schema and FieldServe logic was not documented
2. **Lost Rationale**: The reason for renaming `asset_status` to `current_state` was in a Slack thread that was hard to find
3. **No Coordination Process**: There was no systematic way to notify FieldServe of AssetLink changes
4. **Historical Context Lost**: Previous similar incidents were not easily discoverable

## How This Incident Led to FS-D1

This incident directly led to Decision FS-D1: "Require explicit recording of AssetLink schema changes impacting FieldServe."

The incident review concluded:
- The technical fix (updating FieldServe to use `current_state`) was straightforward
- The process gap (lack of coordination and documentation) was the real problem
- A systematic approach to recording dependencies and changes was needed
- The Product Ledger could provide the durable, queryable record needed

## AI Assistance and Human Review

This summary was:
- **AI-Assisted**: Initial draft generated from incident logs, Slack threads, and monitoring data
- **Human-Reviewed**: Incident responders verified facts, added context, and corrected interpretations
- **Human-Approved**: Final version approved by incident commander and product managers

The AI assistance helped:
- Aggregate information from multiple sources quickly
- Identify patterns in logs and errors
- Draft initial narrative structure

Human review ensured:
- Accuracy of technical details
- Appropriate business context
- Correct attribution of decisions
- Alignment with team understanding

## Lessons Learned

1. **Explicit Dependencies Matter**: Implicit dependencies between systems are a source of risk
2. **Context Preservation**: Rationale for changes must be preserved in durable, queryable form
3. **Coordination Process**: Systematic processes for cross-team coordination are essential
4. **Historical Context**: Past incidents should be easily discoverable to prevent repeats

## Actions Taken

1. **Immediate**: Updated FieldServe to use new `current_state` field
2. **Short-term**: Established FS-D1 decision and recording process
3. **Long-term**: Building Product Ledger materials and links to support ongoing coordination
