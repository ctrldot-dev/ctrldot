# Kesteron Enterprise Intent Overview

## Kesteron's High-Level Objectives

Kesteron operates customer-critical services that require:
- **Reliability**: Services must be available and performant
- **Explainability**: Changes and decisions must be traceable
- **Accountability**: Teams must be able to show why decisions were made
- **Coherence**: System changes must align with business objectives

## Why Traceability and Coherence Matter at Board Level

### Regulatory and Compliance
- External stakeholders require audit trails
- Compliance frameworks demand decision traceability
- Risk management requires understanding of system dependencies

### Business Continuity
- Customer trust depends on reliable, explainable services
- Incident response requires quick access to decision context
- Strategic planning needs visibility into system evolution

### Organizational Learning
- Past decisions inform future strategy
- Patterns in incidents reveal systemic issues
- Knowledge must survive team changes and tool migrations

## How Product, Intent, and Ledger Reinforce Each Other

### Product Layer
- **Products** (like FieldServe, AssetLink) deliver customer value
- **Goals** define what products should achieve
- **Jobs** describe user needs products address
- **Work Items** are concrete steps toward goals

### Intent Layer
- **Strategic Objectives** (SO) define enterprise direction
- **Assurance Obligations** (AO) ensure compliance and risk management
- **Transformation Themes** (TT) guide organizational change

### Ledger Layer
- **Operations** record what happened and when
- **Decisions** capture why changes were made
- **Evidence** provides support for decisions
- **Materials** preserve human-readable context

Together, these layers create:
- **Alignment**: Products support enterprise intent
- **Traceability**: Decisions link to goals and evidence
- **Coherence**: Changes align with strategic direction
- **Durability**: Context survives time and organizational change

## How AI is Used Responsibly Within This System

### AI Assistance, Human Oversight
- AI helps aggregate information and draft summaries
- Humans review, verify, and approve all AI-generated content
- Decision authority remains with humans
- AI is a tool, not a decision-maker

### Explicit Boundaries
- AI assistance is explicitly noted in materials (e.g., "AI-assisted, human-approved")
- Human review and approval are required for all critical content
- AI cannot create or modify ledger records without human intent

### Transparency
- The system makes it clear when AI was involved
- Human reviewers are identified
- Decision processes are documented
- Audit trails show human oversight

## The Product Ledger Thesis

The Product Ledger demonstrates that:
- **Explicit is Better than Implicit**: Dependencies and decisions should be recorded
- **Durable is Better than Ephemeral**: Context should survive tool and team changes
- **Structured is Better than Unstructured**: Links and relationships enable queryability
- **Human-Readable is Essential**: Materials provide narrative context machines cannot

This system enables Kesteron to:
- Maintain operational coherence as systems evolve
- Respond to incidents with full context
- Make strategic decisions with historical perspective
- Demonstrate accountability to stakeholders
